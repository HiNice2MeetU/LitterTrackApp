# LitterTrackApp 
A android app to track litter

#### What is this?
This is a little app I have been developing for a while now. It is designed to raise awarness about littering, pollution and the environment.
You take a photo of a piece of trash, then it will automatically geotag it and put it on a map (Then you put it in the bin because thats the 
right thing to do). 

#### For What Platforms?
It is being developed as an android app in java + the backend (which is not in this repo) is also developed in java!

#### Uses
- Android Studio
- Java Paho Client  (Backend)
- GSON 2.8.6
- Sqlite JDCB 3.34.0 (Backend)
- MQTT
